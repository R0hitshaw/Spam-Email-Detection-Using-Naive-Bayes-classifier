# Spam Email Detection using Naive Bayes Classifier

Spam Email Detection is a Python project aimed at automatically identifying and filtering out spam emails using the Naive Bayes Classifier. This system offers a reliable solution for managing email inboxes by efficiently categorizing incoming emails as either spam or legitimate.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification, providing efficient and accurate spam detection.
- **Laplace Smoothing**: Implements Laplace smoothing to handle zero probabilities and enhance the robustness of the classifier.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses email data for analysis, including tokenization, stop word removal, and special character handling.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from email content using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) techniques.
- **Training and Testing**: Facilitates training the classifier on labeled datasets and includes functionalities for cross-validation and model evaluation.
- **Integration Guides**: Optional guides for integrating the trained classifier into email systems for real-time spam filtering.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided to assess classifier performance.
